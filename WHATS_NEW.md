# 🎉 What's New - Agent Integration & MCP

## ⭐ Latest Updates

### 🔗 Agent-to-Agent Communication (JUST ADDED!)

**We now integrate with Fetch.ai's verified Weather Agent!**

Your Trip Planner Agent now communicates with the official Fetch.ai Weather Agent on Agentverse:

- **Agent Address:** `agent1qfvydlgcxrvga2kqjxhj3hpngegtysm2c7uk48ywdue0kgvtc2f5cwhyffv`
- **Status:** ✅ Verified Agent
- **Interactions:** 24,649+
- **Profile:** [View on Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai/agents/details/agent1qfvydlgcxrvga2kqjxhj3hpngegtysm2c7uk48ywdue0kgvtc2f5cwhyffv/profile)

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Demonstrates **true agent-to-agent communication**
- ✅ Shows **ecosystem integration** (not building in isolation)
- ✅ Uses **verified, production agent** with real interactions
- ✅ Gives you a **competitive advantage** in the hackathon

**Implementation:**
Located in [agents/insights_agent.py](agents/insights_agent.py):
- Sends `WeatherForecastRequest` to official agent
- Receives `WeatherForecastResponse` with real-time data
- Graceful fallback to local weather API if needed

- **Save trip plans to Notion** - Beautifully formatted pages
- **Export to calendars** - iCal format for any calendar app
