# Agentverse Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying your Trip Planner Agent to Fetch.ai's Agentverse platform.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Trip Planner Agent running locally without errors
- [ ] Fetch.ai account (create at https://agentverse.ai/)
- [ ] Agent address from local testing
- [ ] This GitHub repository URL

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Agent with Agentverse Registration (Recommended for Hackathon)

This keeps your agent running locally but makes it discoverable on Agentverse.

#### Step 1: Get Your Agent Address

```bash
python run_single_agent.py
```

Copy the agent address shown (starts with `agent1q...`)

#### Step 2: Register on Agentverse

1. Go to https://agentverse.ai/
2. Log in or create account
3. Click "Create Agent" or "My Agents" â†’ "New Agent"

#### Step 3: Configure Agent Details

**Basic Information:**

  Provides destination recommendations, detailed itineraries, budget optimization, weather
  insights, and cultural tips through natural conversation.
  ```
- **Agent Type**: Local Agent
- **Agent Address**: Paste your agent address from Step 1

**Function Configuration:**
- **Function Name**: `trip_planning`
- **Function Description**:
  ```
  Plan your perfect trip with AI-powered personalization. Get destination recommendations
  based on your budget and interests, create detailed day-by-day itineraries, optimize
  your travel budget, and receive local insights and cultural tips.
  ```

**Keywords** (important for discovery):
```

adventure, recommendations, planning assistant
```

2. Try queries like:
   - "I want to plan a 7-day trip to Japan"
   - "Recommend a beach destination for a couple on moderate budget"

### Option 2: Hosted Agent on Agentverse

For full cloud deployment:

#### Step 1: Prepare Code for Upload

Create a single-file version combining all agents:

```bash
# Your main agent file should be self-contained
# Use run_single_agent.py as the base
```

#### Step 2: Upload to Agentverse

1. In Agentverse, select "Hosted Agent"
2. Upload your `run_single_agent.py`
3. Upload `utils/` folder
4. Add dependencies from `requirements.txt`

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In Agentverse settings, add:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

#### Step 4: Deploy and Test

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for agent to start
3. Test in DeltaV

## Making Your Agent Discoverable

### Optimize for DeltaV Search

Your agent's discoverability depends on:

1. **Good Description**: Clear, keyword-rich description
2. **Relevant Keywords**: Include all related terms
3. **Function Details**: Well-defined function parameters
4. **Testing**: Regular testing improves ranking
